# Data Information

The data in this `anonymised` directory is anonymized. Each record is identified by a `PUBLIC_ID`, which is not the actual `PUBLIC_ID` of the individuals. This ensures the privacy and confidentiality of the data subjects.

Please handle the data responsibly and adhere to all relevant data protection regulations.
